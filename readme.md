I just bumped carbon version for new laravel versions.

# JDate

Date converter from Jalali to Georgian and vice versa. It has Carbon instance inside and it's Laravel friendly.

This package is using [carbon](https://github.com/briannesbitt/carbon) as core for Georgian calendar.

## Installation

```
$ composer require mastani/laravel-jdate
```

### how to use
 
```php
<?php

require 'vendor/autoload.php';
 
use p3ym4n\JDate\JDate;

JDate::now();                                   //1395-11-08 16:51:08
JDate::today();                                 //1395-11-08 00:00:00
